(** ** Flexible **)
(**
[Flexible] is parameterized by a [System] type, a [Context] type,
an instance of type [System], and sevaral binary relations over [System] and [Context]
representing the relationship between the given [System] set, [Context] set, and some
constituent attribute. The constituent attributes of [Flexibility] are
[Modifiability], [Tailorability], and [Adaptability].

These binary relations represent the given system type's ability to satisfy
the specified requirement in the given context.

Informally, in English:
A system [sys] belonging to the set of systems [System] is deemed [Flexible] given the set of contexts [Context]
if and only if all the requirements of its sub-attributes ([Modifiability], [Tailorability], and [Adaptability])
are satisfied given the same conditions.
