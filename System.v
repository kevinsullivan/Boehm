Record MetaSystem := mk_msys {

Check UnitBoolSystem.

(** Dependent types are amazing! This function is a "getter" parameterized
    by like 7 types, and its return type depends on those types as well!
    We'll use this to reason about the state of our system in our example
    to determine if we want to deem it Changeable. *)

  match sys with

(** This is how the "capital-letter"-ility relations will look now for
    all of our ilities. It requires only a System (and a Model,
    but this can be inferred from the instance given).
    Basically, we're saying
    "If you can give me a callback that takes a [System model] and
    shows that its changeable, I'll agree that it's changeable."
    This simply serves as a generic interface to plug in to. *)

    Changeable sys.

(** Model-specific logic here, this is our callback!
    We'll make use of our system model and specify
    that only "true" systems are changeable. *)

Inductive true_system: UnitBoolSystem -> Prop :=

Theorem instance_is_changeable: Changeable system_instance.
Proof.
  (** Generic framework *)
  constructor.
  (** Little-c changeable *)
  exists unit_bool_changeable.
  intros.
  (** Domain and model-specific reasoning *)
  apply truth_is_changeable.
  apply is_true.
  simpl. reflexivity.
