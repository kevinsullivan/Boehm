[Resiliency] is a composite attribute of [Dependability], [Flexibility], and [Changeability].
A system is [Affordable] only if it meets the requirements of these constient attributes.

Informally,
A system [sys] belonging to the set of systems [System] is deemed [Resilient] for all stakeholders
in set [Stakeholder] given the set of phases and contexts [Context] and [Phase] if and only if all the
requirements of its sub-attributes are satisfied given the same conditions. *)
