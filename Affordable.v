(**
[Affordability] is a composite attribute of [MissionEffective] and [Efficient].
A system is [Affordable] only if it meets the requirements of both [MissionEffective] and [Efficient].

Informally,
A system [sys] belonging to the set of systems [System] is deemed [Affordable] for all stakeholders
in set [Stakeholder] given the set of phases and contexts [Context] and [Phase] if and only if all the
requirements of its sub-attributes ([MissionEffective], and [Efficient]) are satisfied given
the same conditions. *)
