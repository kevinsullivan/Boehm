(** ** Mission Effective **)

(**
In the following definition, [MissionEffective] is parameterized by three typeclasses,
[System], [Stakeholder], and [Context], a system, sys, of type [System], and sevaral ternary
relations over [System], [Context], and/or [Stakeholder].
Those ternary relations are associated with its sub-attributes. For example, physicalCapability is a ternary relation,
which is to say, a set of triples, (s, sh, c), between a system, s, a stakeholder, sh, and a context, c,
that we expect to hold (for the proposition to be provable, iff system s satisfies its mission effective
requirement (which isn't represented explicitly here) in context, c.)

Its definition indicates that the property of a [System] being [MissionEffective] for all [Contexts], the system is
mission effective implicitly for all [Stakeholders] in those [Contexts], only if all the requirements of the subattributes
are satisfied.
