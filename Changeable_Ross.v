(** * Introduction *)

(**
This specification is our formalization, in 
the computational part of Coq's type theory,
Gallina, of the semantic approach by Ross,
Beesemyer, and Rhodes, SEAri Working Paper
Series WP-2011-2-2, revised December 16, 2012,
entitled, "A Prescriptive Semantic Basis for
System Lifecycle Properties." The work gives
an interesting approach to defining meanings 
for (change-related) ility terms (terms such
as "flexibility" and "evolvability". Rather
than attempt to impose a preferred definition
on the community, the paper postulates what
we see as a language of change requirements
statements, and then classifies statements as
belonging to certain classes ("tipes" in this
specification). This specification makes this
idea precise using the concepts of programming
language syntax and semantics, and in particular
the definition of a "tipe" assignment operator
for sentences in a language described by what
amounts to a context-free language for change
related requirements, following Ross et al.
