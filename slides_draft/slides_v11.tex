\section{Contribution}
\begin{frame}{Our Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
		\item A parameterizable hierarchy of qualities and relationships
		\item Quality-specific languages for expressing  requirements
		\item Integration of the distinct, previously conflicting theories.
		\item Web-based software implementations of the theory concepts
		\item An approach for theory testing, evolution, and validation
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.5cm}		
		The overall contribution of this work is a novel, rigorous, and promising new approach to developing, promulgating, testing, evolving, and validating the scientific theory that is needed to underpin rigorous new approaches to comprehensive system quality engineering.
