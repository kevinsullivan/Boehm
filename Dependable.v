(** ** DEPENDABLE**)
(**
In the following definition, [Dependable] is parameterized by two typeclasses, [System],
and [Context], a system, sys, of type [System], and sevaral binary relations over [System], [Context].

Those binary relations are associated with its sub-attributes. For example, [Secure] is one of the sub-attributes, 
and security represents a tenary relation, which is to say, a set of pairs, (s, c), 
between a system, s, and a context, c, that we  intend to hold (for the proposition to be provable, 
iff system s satisfies its [Secure] requirement (which isn't represented explicitly here) in context, c.)

Its definition indicates that the property of a [System] being [Dependable] for all [Contexts], the system is
dependable implicitly in those [Contexts], only if all the requirements of its sub-attributes are satisfied.
